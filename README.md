# React JS - Day 5 🚀

Today was all about **interactivity and conditional rendering** in React!  
Here's a quick summary of what I built and learned:

---

## ✅ What I Learned

### 1. 🔁 Toggle / Hide & Show Elements
- Learned how to **conditionally render** elements using `useState`.
- Created a toggle button to **show/hide components** dynamically.

### 2. 🤹‍♂️ Handling Multiple Conditions in Toggle
- Implemented multiple conditional checks to render content based on **complex logic**.
- Practiced different ways of toggling elements using:
  - Boolean toggles
  - Ternary operators
  - Logical && operator

### 3. 🔢 Counter Component (`Counter.jsx`)
- Built a counter using state management:
  - Increment functionality
  - Decrement (reverse counter) functionality
- Buttons to increase or decrease the value
- Real-time updates to the UI

### 4. 👤 User Component (`User.jsx`)
- Created a separate `User` component to display user details or placeholder content.
- Integrated props and conditional display inside the component.

### 5. 🧩 App Integration (`App.jsx`)
- Integrated all components:
  - Included a toggle button for showing/hiding the **User** component.
  - Connected and displayed `Counter` component.

## 📁 File Structure

src/ │ ├── App.jsx           # Main component ├── Counter.jsx       # Counter component (increment/decrement) └── User.jsx          # User info component (conditionally rendered)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- React JS (with functional components)
- useState hook
- JSX for rendering
- Basic conditional rendering techniques

---

## 💡 What's Next?
- Moving on to props drilling and state lifting.
- Adding style and animations to toggles.
- Learning component composition and reusability.
